World of Warcraft addon that paints a dark mode skin on the standard Blizzard Raid Frames UI. I couldn't find any existing addon that did this.

### Notice:
- Might cause weird interactions with RaidFaidMore or other addons that affect the Blizzard Default Raid Frames
- This is an alpha release and has not been tested in all enounters or for any length of time. Also my first significant addon and Lua project!
- Currently there is no UI for changing options, must be done directly through Lua

### Dependency: 
FrameXML\CompactUnitFrame.lua

### Special Thanks:
Ketho (EU-Boulderfist), author of the RaidFadeMore addon, which I studied and used as the basis for this addon (and in the end removing all of the original functionality)
